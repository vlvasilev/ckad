# Deployment

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Use Case

The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

1. [Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#creating-a-deployment). The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.

2. [Declare the new state of the Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment) by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.

    ```console
    kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
    ```
    ```console
    kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```

    To see the rollout status, run:
    ```console
    kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```

3. [Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment) if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.

    1. First, check the revisions of this Deployment:
    ```console
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    2. To see the details of each revision, run:
    ```console
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment --revision=2
    ```
    3. Rolling Back to a Previous Revision 
    ```console
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    4. Alternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with `--to-revision`:
    ```console
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
    ```

4. [Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment).
    ```console
    kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
    ```

    Assuming horizontal Pod autoscaling is enabled in your cluster:
    ```console
    kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80
    ```

5. [Pause the rollout of a Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#pausing-and-resuming-a-deployment) to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.

    ```console
    kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    ```console
    kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```


6. [Use the status of the Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#deployment-status) as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.


7. [Clean up older ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#clean-up-policy) that you don't need anymore.

    You can set `.spec.revisionHistoryLimit` field in a Deployment to specify how many old ReplicaSets for this Deployment you want to retain. The rest will be garbage-collected in the background. By default, it is 10.
